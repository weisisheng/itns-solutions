Hilgard (2015) asked male participants to play a video game for 15 minutes.  The game was customized so that it could vary in violence (shooting zombies or helping aliens) and difficulty (targets controlled by tough AI or dumb AI).  After the game, players were provoked by being given an insulting evaluation by a confederate.  Participants then got to decide how long the confederate should hold their hand in painfully cold ice water (0-80s in 10s increments), and this was taken as a measure of aggressive behavior.

This is a simplified data set from Hilgard (2015).  The numbers represent the agression scores, which were rated on a scale from 0 to 80s in 10s increments.  Each column is the set of scores for a difference condition in the study.

In SPSS:
Condition -- both violence and difficulty ratings combined; 1 = nonviolent-easy, 2 = nonviolent-hard, 3 = violent-easy, 4 = violent-hard
difficulty -- 1 = easy, 2 = hard
violence -- 1 = nonviolent, 2 = violent
aggression_rating -- measure of participant aggressive behavior
