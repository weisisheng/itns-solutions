To what extent do emotional responses alter heart rate?  To find out,  participants were asked to recall memories of intense happiness or anger.  Heart rate was measured using a cell phone app in beats per minute.   Heart rate was measured for each participant before emotion recall (HR_baseline), during anger recall (HR_anger), and during happiness recall (HR_happiness).   The order of emotion recall was counterbalanced.    

As a manipulation check, participants also rated how intensely they were able to feel each emotion during the recall task on a scale  from 0 (absolutely not intense) to 8 (extremely intense) .

This is a simplified dataset that has data only for baseline and anger.  The data for happiness is not included here.

* ID 
* First_emotion - anger or happiness, determined by coin flip
* First_Emotion_code - anger = 1, happiness = 2
* HR_baseline - heart rate measured in beats per minute during baseline period prior to emotion recall
* HR_anger - heart rate measured in beats per minute during recall of times of intense anger
* SR_anger - self-reported intensity of feeling angry during angry recall, scale from 0-8
