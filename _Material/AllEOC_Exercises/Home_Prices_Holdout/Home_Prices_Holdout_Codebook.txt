This is a holdout sample of an additional 10 cases from the HOUSES dataset from https://wiki.csc.calpoly.edu/datasets/wiki/Houses

In addition, this table shows asking price predicted from size based on the regression equation from the initial dataset (first tab), residual of prediction, and square of the residual of prediction.

New case: identifying number of house
Size: size of house in square meters
Y:
Lower 95% PI: Lower value of predicted price range
Higher 95% PI: Upper value of predicted price range
Actual Asking Price: Notes the actual asking price of the house
Within PI: Notes whether the actual asking price of the house falls within the prediction interval
Residual: 
ResS:
