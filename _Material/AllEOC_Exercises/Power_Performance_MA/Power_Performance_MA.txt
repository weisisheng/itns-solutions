To what extent can feeling powerful improve your performance?

To find out, Burgmer and Englich (2012) manipulated power by:
* Asking participants to recall either a nuetral memory or a time when they had power over others (Experiment 1)
* Asking participants to complete a word search where the words were either neutral or related to power (Experiment 2)

Next, participants were asked to perform a motor task: either golf (Experiment 1) or darts (Experiment 2).  In both studies, participants primed to feel powerful performaed substantially better than the control group.  This study was conducted in Germany.

Cusack et al. (2015) conducted a series of replications in the U.S. to better understand how much power might affect performance.  In addition to a close replication of Burgmer & Englich's first study (Experiment 1) they tried a number of variations.  Specifically, they tried different ways of manipulating power (memory and word-search), different types of tasks (golf, mirror tracing, and a cognitive word-production task),  different sample types (online or undergrads), and different difficulties (normal or hard).  

* Country -- if the study was conducted in Germany (in German) or the U.S. (in English)
* Country_Code - 1 = US, 2 = Germany
* Sample - if the sample was drawn from an undergrad populaiton or from an online site
* Sample_Code - 1 = Undergrad, 2 = Online
* Difficulty - if the task was of normal difficulty or high difficulty
* Difficulty_code - 1 = normal, 2 = difficult
* Manipulation - if power was manipulated by memory recall or by word search
* Manipulation_Code - 1 = memory, 2 = word search
* DVType - if the dependent variable was a motor task or a cognitive task
* DV - If the dependent variable was golf, darts, mirror-tracing, or word production
* Study - name of the study
* M_control - mean for the control group
* SD_control - SD for the control group
* M_power - mean for the power group
* SD_power - SD for the power group
* Cohen d - standardized effect size difference comparing control to power groups where positive numbers indicater an advantage for the power group.
* N_control - sample size for control grop
* N_power - sample size for power group
