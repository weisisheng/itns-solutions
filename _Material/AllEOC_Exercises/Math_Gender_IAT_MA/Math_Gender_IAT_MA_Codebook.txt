ManyLabs 1: Replication of gender difference in impliciat attitudes about math.  

To what extent is gender related to implicit attitudes about bias?  To find out, Nosek and colleagues as male and female students to complete an Implicit Association Test (IAT) that measured how easily negative ideas could be connected to art or to mathematics.  Higher scores indicate higher levels of bias against mathematics.

This is summary data from replication attempts from 30 of the 36 different Many Lab locations:
* Location - the lab that collected the data
* M_male - mean IAT score for males
* SD_male - SD for males on IAT
* N_male - sample size for males
* M_female - mean IAT score for females, where higher scores represent stronger negative bias towards math and negative scores represent stronger negative bias towards art.
* SD_female - SD for females on IAT
* N_female - sample size for females
* Subset - if the study was conducted in the USA or not
* Subset_Code - 0 = not USA, 1 = USA
* Country - country where study was conducted
