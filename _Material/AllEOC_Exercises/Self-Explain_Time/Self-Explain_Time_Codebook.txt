Self-explaining is a study strategy where students explain material to themselves as they learn.  McEldoon, Durkin & Rittle-Johnson examined the benefits of self-explaining for grade school students learning math.  

Students first took a pre-test for conceptual knowledge, then studied, then took a post-test for conceptual knowledge.  

Some students were randomly assigned to normal study, others to self-explain.  However, self-explaining takes longer than traditional study, so a third set of children completed regular study + additional practice.  

Data from all 3 conditions is proivded here, graciously shared by the authors.  The scores are % correct on each phase of testing.  There were additional measures made in this study that are not in this simplified data set.
